Working with a LA company named HomeDescription where we are trying to determine what are the most important factors in selling a house.  Our project mostly focused on to what extent does the home description on Zillow determine how fast the house will sell and for what price.  Zillow calculates the recommended price of the house, called the Zestimate, and we use that to determine if the owner was able to sell the house at a marked up price or a discounted price based on the home description on Zillow.
